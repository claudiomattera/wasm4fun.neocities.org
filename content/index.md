wAsM 4 FuN
====

A collection of my free games developed in [Rust] using [WASM-4] engine.

WASM-4 is a minimalistic fantasy game console running in a browser (and on other environments supporting WebAssembly) exposing the following hardware.

* ![](/assets/images/display.png) Display: 160x160 pixels using 4-colours customizable palette
* ![](/assets/images/memory.png) Memory: 64 KiB
* ![](/assets/images/floppy.png) Cartridge size: 64 KiB
* ![](/assets/images/disk.png) Disk storage: 1 KiB

By constraining the hardware, WASM-4 aims to make it easier to start *and finish* developing a game.
It also makes the development focusing on gameplay rather than on fancy graphics.
