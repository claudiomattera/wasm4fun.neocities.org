wAsM 4 FuN
====

A collection of my free games developed in [Rust] using [WASM-4] engine.

WASM-4 is a minimalistic fantasy game console running in a browser (and on other environments supporting WebAssembly) exposing the following hardware.

* display: 160Ã—160 pixels using 4-colours customizable palette;
* memory: 64 KiB;
* cartridge size: 64 KiB;
* disk storage: 1024 B.

By constraining the hardware, WASM-4 aims to make it easier to start *and finish* developing a game.
It also makes the development focusing on gameplay rather than on fancy graphics.
